laser-fingers
=============

Control lasers with your fingers!

Much more documentation needed, but the command to get started is:

 `PYTHON_PATH=../Leap_SDK/lib/ python leaplaser.py`

This assume that you have the Leap_SDK installed into the same directory where 
you have cloned the `laser-fingers` repository.

Brandon Thomas's super awesome Laser Asteroids game 
(https://github.com/echelon/laser-asteroids) was savagely torn apart and many 
components were used for Laser Fingers!
